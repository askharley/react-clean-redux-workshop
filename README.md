## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- See how the vanilla Redux approach can be somewhat boilerplately and bloated
- Learn how we can make writing Redux and understanding the Flux architecture simpler
- Make use of [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) and [redux-actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-actions) to write simpler Redux code

## ðŸ“š Projects

* [start](https://github.com/askharley/react-clean-redux-workshop/tree/master/shop-drop-clean-redux) - a working application that has the vanilla Redux approach implemented
* [final](https://github.com/askharley/react-clean-redux-workshop/tree/master/shop-drop-vanilla-redux) - an example of a final application that's made writing Redux simpler through external libraries

## ðŸš€ How To Use This Workshop
- The slides can be found in PDF form. The slides outline what state management is, why we need it and how Redux ties into it. We go through the vanilla approach to Redux and how we can make use of other libraries to improve out development experience and write better, cleaner and more maintainabl code.
